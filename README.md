You may be wondering, what's new in this one comapred to the previous versions?
Well, the models in this version will keep repeting textures, but without mirroring them!
This was a common problem in older versions and cause certain areas to look unnatural!
So I took the time to remake them all and even add more textures!

Make sure to give credit if you use it!

I would appreciate it if you can hive feedback about this pack in the discord server!
